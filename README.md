The Student Management System (SMS) is a console-based application that helps an educational institution manage student records in a structured and efficient way. Instead of storing information in paper files or scattered spreadsheets, this system provides a digital platform where authorized users can log in and perform basic operations on student data.

The system allows authenticated users to:

Add new student records

View all students

Search for a student by roll number

Update existing student details

Delete a student record

Log out (sign out) safely.
